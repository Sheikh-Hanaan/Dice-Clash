# Dice Clash

## Description
A simple game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, leveraging DOM manipulation for interactive gameplay.

## Rules:

1. **Winning Condition:**
   The first player to reach or exceed a total score of 100 wins the game.

2. **Dice Roll:**
   - Players take turns rolling a standard six-sided die.
   - If a player rolls a 1, their current score resets to 0, and the turn switches to the other player.

3. **Switching Turns:**
   - Rolling a 1 causes an immediate switch of turns between players.
   - The current player can choose to "hold" at any time, adding their current score to their total and passing the turn to the other player.
